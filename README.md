============

[![Project Status: WIP – Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

This project will allow users to visualize trends in Pokémon Showdown data over time. Current functionality includes visualizing usage rates of up to 5 Pokémon over time,
for a selected metagame, time period, and minimum ELO. Improved visuals and additional plots are in development. The app will ultimately be hosted online.
